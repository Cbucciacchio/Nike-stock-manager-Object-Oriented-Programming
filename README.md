# Nike-stock-manager-Object-Oriented-Programming
I work for a Nike warehouse. As store manager I am responsible for managing the warehouse, and more importantly, performing stock taking. To optimise delivery time and for improved organisation, I have decided to use my Python knowledge to get an overview of what each stock-taking session entails.

# Nike warehouses stores the following information for each stock-taking list:
- Country 
- Code
- Product 
- Cost
- Quantity 
- Value
# Other store managers (in other regions) are able to use my program to do the following:
- Search products by code.
- Determine the product with the lowest quantity and restock it.
- Determine the product with the highest quantity.
- Calculate the total value of each stock item. The total value is calculated by multiplying the cost by the quantity for each item entered into the system.

# Technologies used
- python
